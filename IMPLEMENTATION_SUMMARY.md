## 🏗️ Database Schema

### New Table: `subscription_feature_credits`

```sql
- id (UUID/BigInt)
- subscription_id (FK to subscriptions)
- feature_id (FK to features)
- credits (DECIMAL 15,4)
- reason (VARCHAR 255, nullable)
- granted_by_type (VARCHAR 255, nullable)
- granted_by_id (UUID/BigInt, nullable)
- expires_at (TIMESTAMP, nullable)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_subscription_feature` on (subscription_id, feature_id)
- `idx_expires_at` on (expires_at)
- `idx_sub_feat_exp` on (subscription_id, feature_id, expires_at)

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Credit Management
- Grant extra credits to users/subscriptions
- Support for expiration dates
- Audit trail (who granted, when, why)
- Automatic credit consumption (oldest first)

### 2. Enhanced Feature Usage
- Backward-compatible API
- Optional credit inclusion in calculations
- Automatic credit consumption during usage
- Detailed usage statistics

### 3. Query Capabilities
- Filter by feature, subscription, expiration
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Bulk operations support

### 4. Administrative Tools
- Cleanup command for expired credits
- Factory for testing
- Resource for API responses

## 🚀 API Changes

### New Methods Added to Subscription Model

```php
// Credit management
$subscription->grantExtraCredits(string $slug, float $credits, array $options = [])
$subscription->totalExtraCredits(string $slug)
$subscription->extraCreditsForFeature(string $slug)

// Enhanced usage calculation
$subscription->remainingFeatureUsageWithCredits(string $slug)
$subscription->canUseFeatureWithCredits(string $slug, float $value)
$subscription->useFeatureWithCredits(string $slug, float $value)

// Statistics
$subscription->getCreditUsageStats(string $slug)
```

### Enhanced Existing Methods

```php
// Now support optional credit inclusion
$subscription->remainingFeatureUsage(string $slug, bool $includeExtraCredits = true)
$subscription->canUseFeature(string $slug, float $value, bool $includeExtraCredits = true)
$subscription->useFeature(string $slug, float $value, bool $useExtraCredits = true)
```

### New Methods Added to HasSubscription Trait

```php
// User-level credit management
$user->grantExtraCredits(string $slug, float $credits, ?string $reason = null, array $options = [])
$user->extraCredits(string $slug)
$user->totalAvailableCredits(string $slug)
$user->getCreditUsageStats(string $slug)
$user->grantMultipleExtraCredits(array $credits, ?string $reason = null, array $options = [])
```

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Backward Compatible**

- All existing API methods work unchanged
- Default behavior includes extra credits (can be disabled)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Existing tests should continue to pass

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```php
// Grant credits
$user->grantExtraCredits('api-calls', 5, 'Referral bonus');

// Check total available
$total = $user->totalAvailableCredits('api-calls');

// Use features (automatically consumes extra credits first)
if ($user->canUseFeature('api-calls', 10)) {
    $user->useFeature('api-calls', 10);
}
```

### Advanced Usage

```php
// Grant with expiration and audit trail
$user->grantExtraCredits('api-calls', 10, 'Promotion', [
    'expires_at' => now()->addMonths(3),
    'granted_by' => auth()->user()
]);

// Get detailed statistics
$stats = $user->getCreditUsageStats('api-calls');
// Returns: plan_limit, extra_credits, total_available, used, remaining
```

## 🧪 Testing Support

### Factory Usage

```php
// Create test credits
SubscriptionFeatureCredit::factory()
    ->referralBonus()
    ->withCredits(10)
    ->create();

// Create expired credits
SubscriptionFeatureCredit::factory()
    ->expired()
    ->create();
```

## 🛠️ Administrative Commands

```bash
# Clean up expired credits
php artisan larasub:cleanup-expired-credits

# Dry run to see what would be deleted
php artisan larasub:cleanup-expired-credits --dry-run

# Process in smaller batches
php artisan larasub:cleanup-expired-credits --batch-size=500
```

## 📊 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Table configuration
LARASUB_TABLE_SUBSCRIPTION_FEATURE_CREDITS=subscription_feature_credits
LARASUB_TABLE_SUBSCRIPTION_FEATURE_CREDITS_UUID=true
LARASUB_TABLE_SUBSCRIPTION_FEATURE_CREDITS_GRANTED_BY_UUID=true
```

### Model Configuration

```php
// config/larasub.php
'models' => [
    // ... existing models
    'subscription_feature_credits' => \Err0r\Larasub\Models\SubscriptionFeatureCredit::class,
],

'resources' => [
    // ... existing resources
    'subscription_feature_credit' => \Err0r\Larasub\Resources\SubscriptionFeatureCreditResource::class,
],
```

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Validation**: Prevents negative credits and excessive amounts
2. **Authorization**: Supports permission-based credit granting
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of credit grants and usage
4. **Expiration**: Automatic cleanup prevents indefinite accumulation

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

1. **Efficient Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
2. **Batch Processing**: Cleanup command processes in batches
3. **Lazy Loading**: Relationships loaded only when needed
4. **Query Optimization**: Efficient credit consumption algorithm

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Available Metrics
- Total credits granted by period
- Active vs expired credits
- Credits by feature/reason
- Top credit recipients
- Usage patterns and trends

### Scheduled Tasks
- Daily cleanup of expired credits
- Weekly expiration warnings
- Monthly analytics reports

## 🎉 Benefits Delivered

1. **Flexibility**: Supports referrals, promotions, loyalty programs
2. **Scalability**: Efficient database design and queries
3. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code
4. **Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new credit types or rules

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
1. **Credit Transfers**: Allow users to transfer credits
2. **Credit Marketplace**: Buy/sell credits between users
3. **Tiered Expiration**: Different expiration rules by credit type
4. **Usage Limits**: Daily/hourly usage limits for credits
5. **Credit Pools**: Shared credits across teams/organizations
